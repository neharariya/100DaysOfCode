AGGRESSIVE COWS:-

You are given an array consisting of n integers which denote the position of a stall. 
You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. 
You are given the task of assigning stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

        sort(stalls.begin(),stalls.end());
